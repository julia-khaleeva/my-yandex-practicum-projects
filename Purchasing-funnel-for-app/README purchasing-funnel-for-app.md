### Objective

The objective of this project is to analyze the user behavior within a food ordering mobile application. By using data on customer behavior, the project aims to evaluate the sales funnel and assess the results of A/A/B testing.

### Approach
This project focuses on analyzing user behavior in a mobile application, specifically a food ordering app. The main objective is to evaluate the sales funnel and assess the results of A/B testing for a new app design. The analysis was performed using Python, and the hypotheses testing indicated that the new design did not significantly affect user behavior as the null hypothesis was not rejected.
