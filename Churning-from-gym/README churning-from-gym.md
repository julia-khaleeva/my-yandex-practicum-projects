## Customer Churn Prediction for Health Clubs

### Technologies used
Python, 
Matplotlib, 
Pandas, 
Scikit-learn, 
Seaborn, 
classification, 
cluster analysis, 
machine learning.

### Objective

The objective of this project is to predict customer churn for health clubs. By analyzing customer data, we aim to create customer profiles using cluster analysis and predict the probability of leaving in the next month for each customer. Based on the results, we will develop a retention plan to reduce churn.

### Approach

Using Python we build a binary classification model of customers, where the target feature is the fact that a customer leaves in the next month. Train the model on the training sample using logistic regression and random forest algorithms. Evaluate the models using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics. Compare the performance of logistic regression and random forest. Generate policy recommendations based on the analysis and insights obtained from the model.

### Conclusion

After comparing the performance of logistic regression and random forest, it was found that logistic regression on standardized data provides better results in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall metrics. By utilizing cluster analysis, we identified factors associated with a higher probability of customer churn. These findings can be used to develop a retention plan to reduce churn and improve customer satisfaction.
